# stanpmx-library

This is a collection of pharmacometric models written in Stan + Torsten and R. In this repo are templates
for many common and less-common models in Stan + Torsten - basic one- and two-compartment 
IV and/or oral models, Michaelis-Menten elimination, indirect response models, the Friberg-Karlsson 
model, the Savic transit compartment absorption model, viral dynamics models, models with covariates,
BLOQ-handling, exposure-response analyses, etc. â€¦. There are also tutorials that are both theoretical
and practical in nature. I believe that making these models public along with tutorials that provide 
guidance will give users in the PMx community enough of a knowledge platform and a code template that 
they can implement a fully Bayesian workflow that involves fake data simulation, model fitting, 
post-processing of the posterior distribution, model diagnostics, model selection, and making predictions 
and future simulations, for any model that they desire. 

Hopefully, these resources will help aspiring Bayesians overcome some of the early barriers to entry 
(knowledge, code) while providing a collection of scripts and models for the PMx community to use as a 
stepping stone to implement their own Bayesian models in their drug-development process. It will hopefully 
become a user-driven repository where pharmacometricians can submit their own models and tutorials that 
they think others in the PMx world could benefit from.
